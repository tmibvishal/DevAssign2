            Descriptive Paragraph
            1. Describe: I am going to DESCRIBE a sunset!

            Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple
            swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a blender. The sun moves slowly to hide
            behind
            the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to
            a
            crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that still must be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when
            the
            sun does set.

            Informational Paragraph and a Narrative Paragraph
            2. Inform: I am going to INFORM you about the Apollo 11 space mission.

            On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its mission
            was to
            go where no human being had gone before—the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and
            Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility, a basaltic flood plain, on July
            20,
            1969. The moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander Neil
            Armstrong emerged from the Lunar Module and took his famous first step onto the moon’s surface. He declared,
            “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental moment in human history!

            Narrate: I am going to NARRATE a story about the Apollo 11 space mission.

            It was July 21, 1969, and Neil Armstrong awoke with a start. It was the day he would become the first human
            being to ever walk on the moon. The journey had begun several days earlier, when on July 16th, the Apollo 11
            launched from Earth headed into outer space. On board with Neil Armstrong were Michael Collins and Buzz
            Aldrin.
            The crew landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility a day before the actual walk. Upon Neil’s first step
            onto
            the moon’s surface, he declared, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It sure was!

            Process or How-to Paragraph
            3. Process: I am going to explain the PROCESS of cleaning and organizing your room.
            OR
            How-to: I am going to describe HOW-TO clean and organize your room.

            Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room. First, move all of the items that do not have a proper
            place
            to the center of the room. Get rid of at least five things that you have not used within the last year. Take
            out
            all of the trash, and place all of the dirty dishes in the kitchen sink. Now find a location for each of the
            items you had placed in the center of the room. For any remaining items, see if you can squeeze them in
            under
            your bed or stuff them into the back of your closet. See, that was easy!

            Compare and Contrast Paragraph
            4. Compare/Contrast: I am going to COMPARE and CONTRAST an ocean and a lake.

            Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodies of water, but
            oceans
            are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of fresh water. Lakes are usually
            surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plants and animals living in them.
            The
            ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes support much smaller forms of life. When
            it is
            time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy.

            Critical Paragraph
            5. Critique: I am going to CRITIQUE the Blue Whales’ first baseball game of the new season.

            The Blue Whales just played their first baseball game of the new season; I believe there is much to be
            excited
            about. Although they lost, it was against an excellent team that had won the championship last year. The
            Blue
            Whales fell behind early but showed excellent teamwork and came back to tie the game. The team had 15 hits
            and
            scored 8 runs. That’s excellent! Unfortunately, they had 5 fielding errors, which kept the other team in the
            lead the entire game. The game ended with the umpire making a bad call, and if the call had gone the other
            way,
            the Blue Whales might have actually won the game. It wasn’t a victory, but I say the Blue Whales look like
            they
            have a shot at the championship, especially if they continue to improve.

            Persuasive Paragraph and Argumentative Paragraph
            6. Persuade: I am going to PERSUADE my neighbors to buy tickets to the school fair.

            The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited
            number
            of tickets at a discount, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an
            event you will not want to miss! First off, the school fair is a great value when compared with other forms
            of
            entertainment. Also, your ticket purchase will help our school, and when you help the school, it helps the
            entire community. But that’s not all! Every ticket you purchase enters you in a drawing to win fabulous
            prizes.
            And don’t forget, you will have mountains of fun because there are acres and acres of great rides, fun
            games,
            and entertaining attractions! Spend time with your family and friends at our school fair. Buy your tickets
            now!

            Argue: I am going to present a logical ARGUMENT as to why my neighbor should attend the school fair.

            The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. Even though you may be busy,
            you
            will still want to reserve just one day out of an entire year to relax and have fun with us. Even if you
            don’t
            have much money, you don’t have to worry. The school fair is a community event, and therefore prices are
            kept
            low. Perhaps, you are still not convinced. Maybe you feel you are too old for fairs, or you just don’t like
            them. Well, that’s what my grandfather thought, but he came to last year’s school fair and had this to say
            about
            it: “I had the best time of my life!” While it’s true you may be able to think of a reason not to come, I’m
            also
            sure you can think of several reasons wh
